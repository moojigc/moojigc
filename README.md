## Hi
Visit my website at [mooji.gg](https://mooji.gg)

### Current
I'm a Software Engineer at Unite Us, a technology company that builds coordinated care networks of health and social service providers. I focus on creating highly-scalable, distributed cloud-based applications.

In my spare time, I'm learning about game development.

### Background
Previously, I was a software engineer at Salusion, where I developed a tech-based solution for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Health Reimbursement Agreements (HRAs).

I have a B.A. in Economics from New York University and a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the UConn Coding Boot Camp, a 24-week intensive program where I learned the latest web development technologies and best practices for succeeding as a full stack web developer. 

Many of my projects in GitHub were developed over the course of the bootcamp, which focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB/MySQL, Express.js, React, Node.js).
